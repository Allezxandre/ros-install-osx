ros-install-osx
===============

This repo aims to maintain a usable, scripted, up-to-date installation procedure for
[ROS](http://ros.org). The intent is that `install-ros.sh` may be executed on a bare
Mavericks or Yosemite machine and produce a working desktop_full installation,
including RQT, rviz, and Gazebo.

This is the successor to my [popular gist on the same topic][1].
